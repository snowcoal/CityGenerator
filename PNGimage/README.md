PLEASE NOTE:

All the code in this folder was NOT written by me (snowcoal), it is borrowed from a computer science class I took at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (it was provided for an assignment).
I used this code because I have it on hand and know how to use it.
Although it did come from a good source, and I do trust it, please use it AT YOUR OWN RISK, as I cannot 100% guarantee the safety of it as I did not write it (but seriously Ive had zero issues).

This code is only used to edit PNG images, and import/export them. If you have an issue with this code, with some edits to City.cpp/City.h, a library such as openCV could be used in place of it.
