PLEASE NOTE:

All the code in this folder was NOT written by me (snowcoal), it was borrowed from a computer science class I took at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (it was provided for the assignment).
I used this code only because I have it on hand and know how to use it.
Although it did come from a good source, and I do trust it, please use it AT YOUR OWN RISK, as I cannot 100% guarantee the safety of it since I did not write it.

This code is ONLY used for exporting/importing to and from PNG images, so it could be replaced with a library such as openCV if you wish to do so.
